        Datasheet  2 of 23 V 1.6  
www.infineon.com/soi    2023 -06-08 6ED223 0S12T  
1200 V Three Phase Gate Driver with Integrated Bootstrap Diode and OCP  
 
Description  
The 6ED2230S12T is a high voltage, high speed IGBT with three independent high side and low side referenced 
output channels for three phas e applications. Proprietary HVIC and latch immune CMOS technologies enable 
ruggedized monolithic construction. The logic input is compatible with standard CMOS or TTL outputs, down 
to 3.3 V logic. An over -current protection (OCP) function which terminates all six outputs can also be derived 
from this resistor. An open drain FAULT signal is provided to indicate that an over -current or undervoltage 
shutdown has occurred. Fault conditions are cleared automatically after a delay programmed externally via 
an RC network. The output drivers feature a high -pulse current buffer stage designed for minimum driver
